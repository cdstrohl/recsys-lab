# Decisions

Non-obvious choices, newest last. Any change to a metric, candidate set or
eligibility rule needs a new entry here and a re-run of every model.

## D-001 Tooling (REC-01)
Python 3.11, `uv` with committed `uv.lock`, pytest, ruff, mypy (strict on `src`).
numpy is the only runtime dependency. pandas waits until a ticket needs it (likely
REC-04).

## D-002 Data acquisition is manual (REC-01)
The repo ships written acquisition steps (`data/README.md`) and **no download
code**, by owner instruction. The shared data standard says repos "ship download
scripts, not data". We read its intent as "ship the means to get the data, never
the data itself", and manual steps meet that more strictly. The owner downloads
MIND-small after reviewing the Microsoft Research License Terms. Raw files,
archives and article text are never committed.

## D-003 Parser policy (REC-01)
- Original MIND TSVs only, no header row. `news.tsv` must have 8 columns and `behaviors.tsv` 5.
- **Strict by default:** the first malformed row raises `ParseError` with file:line and a reason. `strict=False` skips malformed rows and counts them by reason. The inventory uses lenient mode, so one run shows every problem in the real files.
- Blank lines are skipped and counted, never treated as errors. A `\r\n` line ending is accepted. Only the line terminator is stripped, so trailing empty columns (empty abstract or entities) are kept.
- **Duplicate IDs:** the first row is kept and later rows are reported as `duplicate_id`.
- **Duplicate news ID within one impression:** rejected as `duplicate_candidate`. Tie-breaking (D-008) keys on news ID, so duplicates would make it ambiguous.
- **Timestamps:** `M/D/YYYY h:MM:SS AM|PM` is parsed without depending on locale, into a naive `datetime`. MIND states no time zone and none is assumed.
- **Fields:** history and candidates split on whitespace, and an empty history becomes `()`. Entity columns stay raw JSON strings until a ticket needs them.
- Error details name IDs and timestamps only, never article text.

## D-004 Repo contents (REC-01)
The shared agent rules (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and planning docs (`docs/`) stay
local and gitignored, because they reference other projects and private context.
The public repo is self-describing through `README.md`, `data/README.md` and this
file.
